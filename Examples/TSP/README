Original code:
https://github.com/chncyhn/simulated-annealing-tsp

iters = log(stopT/startT)/log(alpha)
defaults:
stopT=1E-8
startT=sqrt(N)
alpha=.995

three versions:
seq.py: explicit loop over each try
map.py: map the anneal function over an array of tries
par.py: use multiprocessing to do the map in parallel on k workers

To run:
make sure X forwarding is enabled so the output graphs can be displayed
python {seq,map,par}.py trials
